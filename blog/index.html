<p>It has been two months and some changes since I begun my faculty appointment. It has also been two months and some change since I have posted anything :/. It's a coincidence, of course. And I am sure you will understand.  I have two words to describe the experiences thus far: intense and exciting! The train has left the station, and there ain't no stopping it.</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><img style="float: center" src="../locomotive.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10"></div>

<p>Right out of the door, I began writing a huge grant with a colleague at Boston's Children Hospital, as well as two smaller grants. These were the first major grant writing effort I have been involved in. It was a highly pleasant experience overall. Like with anything you do for the first time, there is bound to be a certain amount of doubt/discomfort: the trick is to push through despite the discomfort. If you are currently a postdoc, what they tell you (and I think this is great advice), is that you should get some experience writing grant, so that you can hit the ground running. I consciously decided to focus on more research during my postdoc, as I was aiming to get stuff out that I thought would make me more marketable. I think both approaches have some merit, you should make sure you discuss this with your mentor and <em>consciously</em> pick one. We wrote the grant fully in Tex, and used git for version control. It was a great and seamless process to update files and compile the final document which, whether it gets funded or not, I am extremely proud of. Now, for the intense part. The novelty of it all is what I struggled with the most: here I am, having just started my job, and having to figure out how to put a budget together (WTF is fringe? direct/indirect costs? modular budget?!!), a bio sketch (nerds, we're not too good at speaking highly of ourselfves), figuring out my needs for the grant (students, postdocs, equipment etc...), while trying to maintain 100% focus on writing the science. I'm sure that sentence was exhausting to read. It was exhausting to write. I am very lucky that there is staff in place to help with the details of formatting and budget etc...I was equally lucky that my colleague at BCH and I share the sentiment that it is important to <strong>start writing early</strong>! This might have been my first grant, but I am convinced that the only way I'll be able to do it again is by giving myself plenty of time between start and submission - it's just how my mind operates. This deserves a separate post: I really think of writing science/a paper/a grant as storytelling. You are telling the story of your work/idea/result. And this takes time. Because the story starts one way, and morphs into ways you may not have expected. But if you're like me, the early days of the process are painful because you're mostly starting at a blank page on a screen!</p>
<p>It's been really exciting because now I am running my own show. With the excitement though, comes a certain amount of fear. It's like an oh-sh+t-the-training-wheels-are-off moment. I have been very fortunate that my thesis and postdoc advisor gave me lots of freedom and space to explore my own ideas. That has equipped me with lots of confidence with my ability to generate and write about ideas that are worth writing about. It's one thing to have your own ideas, though, and execute them yourself. It's another animal altogether to guide someone else to execute your vision. It's the part of the job that is requiring the most shift in mental attitude, and I love it. It's a great opportunity to grow as a leader. I do not think a lot of people appreciate how challenging it is to have conceived/solved in your mind the path of an idea from beginning to end (publication), only to realize that to convey the route to someone else is much much more difficult. I am much more appreciative of how patient my mentors/collaborators must have been with me. But I am loving every moment of it, because equally eye opening and exilarating have been moments when, while discussing a research idea, my mind felt like a train, my thoughts passengers on this train, and to see that some people just have the ability to hop on this train and get it! That's what collaborative research should feel like.</p>
<p>I promised you a few posts on the academic job search. Tis the season, and I already have outlines for these posts. I shall start posting them soon. In the mean time, if you know students interesting in a PhD and would want to join the train of my ideas, holla! And stay tuned for posts about some of the exciting research we've been working on with my group!</p>

<p>The past few years have been an extremely confusing and uncomfortable time for me, as a black man in America, more specifically
as an African immigrant. It all started with Trayvon, Michael Brown, then Eric Garner, then Sandy and then and then.... The list
goes on. I do not want to discuss the facts behind these events and whether or not justice has been served. I am neither qualified
nor well-versed enough to go into a deep, detailed, discussion. Still, there is something about writing, even when what one is writing
about are half-baked ideas, be they mathematical, philosophical or fictional, that helps/forces one to organize their thoughts and
gain insight. That is one of the reasons I write, and this is something I expect of my students and postdocs: write it down, share
an <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">ipython notebook</a>, not just for me, but also for yourself. Now that we're past this digression, what I would like to discuss is
how I experienced the events of the past few years, and the shift in thinking that these events have engendered in me. The gist is
the following:</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><img style="float: center" src="../past-present-future.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10"></div>

<p><strong>There is a large part of the physical, psychological, experience of being a minority (a woman, African American, Hispanic, Asian, homosexual,
transgender etc...) that cannot be disentangled from the history of a country. The trouble with history is that, revisiting it,
can be uncomfortable <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/04/22/401427275/ben-affleck-kinda-apologizes-for-asking-pbs-program-to-hide-slave-owning-ancesto">ask Ben Affleck</a>.</strong>
I am an applied mathematician, so the Mathematician in me is inclined to abstracting things away. I believe the statement above is true about
the minority experience across time and space. What changes across time are the politics and the economics, and across space the who is/are the
minority group(s) at the forefront of discussions/current events.   Why did I start thinking about this? Well, first, I work in which
that is largely male dominated and where there are very few minorities. The events of the past few years woke up feelings
that I think had been brewing for a while. There is something about the feeling of being 'the only one'/'one of a few of your kind' that gets
amplified when, on the one hand, events mirror the reality of how you are perceived and on the other hand, you do not hear this reality
discussed in your day to day (where you work etc...). A recent chronicle of higher ed article was written on this topic. <a href="https://chroniclevitae.com/news/703-after-ferguson-some-black-academics-wonder-does-pursuing-a-ph-d-matter">Check it out</a>,
it's a great read. Second, I am African, I am black and, whether I like it or not, I have been reaping the benefits of the struggle
and victories won by African Americans over the centuries, since reconstruction, the civil rights movement etc. There was this sense
of guilt brewing inside of me from not understanding the African American experience well enough, while benefiting from it and, at the same time,
carrying the baggage of what it means to be black in America. I would go as far as to say that, if you are an immigrant in this country,
you are in some form or another benefiting from the centuries of wealth accumulated on the backs of African Americans. That's why, I think it
is crucial for one to educate oneself on the African American/Minority experience wherever one finds oneself. At the time when
I started thinking about these ideas, I did not have the language to express them. So I borrowed this language from history and
from the writings of American authors (of various geneders/races).</p>
<p>I read. I read, I read, and I read. I have not read as much in my whole life as I have read over the past 3 to 4 years since I obtained my PhD.
I read authors such as Isabel Wilkerson, Maya Angelou, Chester Himes, James Baldwin, Toni Morrison, Frederick Douglas,
Mark Twain, John Williams, Michelle Alexander. I also read pieces in political magazines on the topic. I closely followed the
writings of Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah, Arthur Chu, Jelani Cobb, Tane-hisi Coates, Brittney Cooper and others. Comedy,
it turns out, has also been an invaluable source. This reading allowed me to form the beginnings of an image for how the past
has come  to shape the African American/black experience in America as we see it on TV, as I experience it. I think that, part of living in a diverse society full of compassion is to understand how history has determined
any form of privilege one is enjoying. I enjoy a huge privilege by virtue of being a male. I realize this. The ways in which I could contribute to
discussions about gender inequality is by (a) being cognizant of this privilege, (b) learning about its origins through history and
(c) listening. So much of the anymosity, the defensiveness around issues of race/gender has to do with the
lack of (c). The path forward will be hard if we are unable to look at others and see a reflection of ourselves, and look in the mirror
and see a reflection of our flaws. <strong>This requires a certain amount of vulnerability. It's
<a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/09/faust-seeks-even-greater-inclusion/?utm_source=SilverpopMailing&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=09.03.2015%20%281%29">uncomfortable,</a>
 it's messy. It's growing pains. But it is possible, perhaps necessary.</strong></p>
<p>I mentioned earlier than one thing that changes across time, when it comes to dealing with these issues, are the politics. The politics
have a huge role to play, especially in the age of Obama. There has been an immense polarization in how Obama has handled the race
issue, and questions of police brutality. One school of thought says, don't talk about race, change policy etc. The other, is
embodied by the Black Lives Matter movement, which says we must tackle it head on and be unapologetic about demanding change. My opinion
on the matter is not fully formed. But the following quote from an <a href="http://thepointmag.com/2015/politics/after-ferguson">article by Brandon M. Terry</a>
is the closest that comes to explaining my current thinking</p>
<p>"Ordinary politics treats these deadly encounters between citizens and police as causal inevitabilities—high crime begets intensive policing,
which brings unfortunate tragedies. But why stop there? What we need is an extraordinary politics informed by ordinary lives, one capable of
provoking, and responsibly guiding, a process of civic reflection in a moment of moral crisis."</p>
<p>Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful: "extraordinary politics informed by ordinary lives".</p>
<p>How can "ordinary lives" guide the politics? One way is through the context provided by history and the lived experiences of people. The context of history is necessary to move forward. Case in point, you have probably heard of the BLM activists who crashed the Bernie Sanders
event in Seattle. That was not cool. But, you have to go past the act and think about the why of the act? I think it's the frustration
among black people, activists, that even well-meaning liberals are only compassionate with their struggle in theory and words. And this,
I think, might be because, of the lack of context regarding black history and the struggle of black America. How can the politics/economics change
anything, unless they are informed by the context of ordinary lives?</p>
<p>I may be wrong. And an old argument, definitely held by conservatives, and by a segment of
black politics, talks about African American responsibility, the degradation of the African American family, and how
African Americans must pull themselves from bootstraps. Even Bill Cosby of all people talks about this. But if you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Warmth-Other-Suns-Migration/dp/0679763880">read</a>
Isabel Wilkerson, if you <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/03/black-pathology-and-the-closing-of-the-progressive-mind/284523/">read</a> some of Coates' writing, and the historical references in both,
you cannot help but question this view. To me, the argument about moral reform is weak because it is devoid of historical context. This would be the same thing as saying something which I think is absurd "well, women have been granted equality decades ago, why can't they
pull themselves by the bootstraps and make as much money as we men do?", "why can't they pull themselves up by the bootstraps and get their voices heard?"
These are absurd statements.</p>
<p>History informs the structural and systemic forces that have led us here. The role of "extraordinary
politics" is to user "ordinary lives" as the basis for policies that will <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/economic-progress-isnt-success/403375/">dismantle these</a>. We might need to wait for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/03/why-kanye-west-would-be-the-best-president-in-us-history-seriously">Kanye's 2020 presidential bid</a> to see such "extraordinary politics".</p>

<p>This is a prelude to a series of posts I plan to write on the academic job search and things I learnt during the process, about looking for a(n) (academic) job, about myself and about Interviewing in general. I was on the academic job market in Spring 2014. I am grateful to have landed a position, after which I decided to defer by a year to wrap up some of my post-doc work and to work on my own company with a colleague and my thesis advisor.</p>
<p>As I am on the eve of officially starting my position, I have been thinking a lot about why I picked <a href="http://seas.harvard.edu">Harvard SEAS</a>, and what I was able to accomplish this past year. This post is going to focus on one seldomly-discussed aspect of the interviewing process, that I believe was tremendously helpful to me. I'll write later about some of the really cool things I did during the year before starting the position. A little bit of background is in order. At the time of applying, I had been a post-doc for 3 years, and a well-seasoned veteran of the industry job search. I had applied and interviewed for everything from positions in finance, on Wall Street (all my friends were doing in it, I was weak and followed, forgive me), to positions in Software Engineering and Data Science. My batting average, I am afraid, was 2/30: I had applied to 30 positions roughly, was flown out to 4 or 5, and got 2 offers. A few things to note. First, 2/30 can seem depressing (and it was), especially from an over-achiever such as myself. Second, the number 2/30 does not reflect the sequence in which those 2 wins came.</p>
<!--![](/wwiwwh.jpg)-->

<div style="text-align:center"><img style="float: center" src="../wwiwwh.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10"></div>

<p>The 2 wins came after I had an epiphany about the 'Interviewing Process', one that had taken me a long time to figure out, because my immigrant, slightly-entitled, stuck-on-a-visa-for-the-past-10-years-despite-my-MIT-credentials self, was projecting the type of body language that, during an interview, screams: this dude is pretty much begging for a job, he does not seem to know what he wants, why would we hire him? What I realized after a string of disappointing, stay-in-your-room-and-brood losses (first-world problems), was that, <strong><em>you are interviewing them too, Demba, as much as they are interviewing you</em></strong>. Before I dig deeper, let me just say that I realize that one may think that there is a certain amount of privilege in this statement. So, let me check my academic privilege. Yes, I have a PhD from MIT. No, by <em>you are interviewing them too, Demba, as much as they are interviewing you</em> I do not mean that I am entitled to any job simply because of my credentials. That would be absurd. You see, the credentials, and most of my grad school friends I have spoken about this with agree, will get your resume somewhere near the top of the pile, but you better make sure you show up damn well-prepared if you wanna take that job, homie. Also, as I said above, I had been on a visa for a while at the time. The thing with being on a visa is that it limits your options and literally robs you of your creative impulses. I am convinced 90% that the I-am-begging-you-for-a-job state of mind that I had started the string of interviews came from this. The feeling of being trapped, of not having any options (I'll touch on this in another post, but immigration reform is important I think, to empower a generation of entrepreneurs who we otherwise rob of their potential). So, no, <em>you are interviewing them too, Demba, as much as they are interviewing you</em> does not come from a place of privilege. What I realized is that, as soon as I adopted this mode of thinking, my body language changed dramatically and, as someone who has been an interviewer, I know very well that body language, demeanor, is something that is easy to pick on. The lack of healthy body language (I am not talking about nervousness) can be a read light to any employer that has invited you to interview (and is therefore considering you as a serious contender for a position). I was still nervous all right, I still felt that my options were limited, but this change in perspective had a number of cognitive effects that went a long way. I started thinking of the interviews as having fun, and actually started having fun during them. I was more inquisitive about places where I interviewed, and started thinking not only about the job, but about how my aspirations/ambitions fit within the culture of the company where I interviewed. And this showed. I started getting the wins. Rejections, after I changed my take on interviewing, did not sting as much as before. I ended up turning down an education start-up that I was very excited about (joining a start-up is way too risky when you are on a visa), and a major Software Engineering company who wanted to turn me into a coder and who I tried to convince to get me a position that involved a research aspect but refused. Their loss.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the academic job search and my experience. By this time, despite having been been battered by the industry job search, I had a healthy sense of what I was looking for in a position, and had the body language that went with it. I was looking for something researchy, an interdisciplinary environment that could keep me interested and on my toes, a not-too-small and not-too-big place with dynamic colleagues. A start-up environment wrapped in velvet academic cloth: <a href="http://seas.harvard.edu">Harvard SEAS</a>! I am sure SEAS is much more! But this is the best image I can come up with after a long and exciting first day of orientation! I don't think I could/would have appreciated SEAS as much had it not been for my giving industry ago and the string of what looked like failures but were actually near wins and ended up preparing me for this big win. <a href="http://sarahelizabethlewis.com/">Sarah Lewis</a> has very nice book titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Rise-Creativity-Failure-Mastery/dp/1451629249">The Rise</a>. The book is loosely about how, <strong><em>at times, we perceive the culmination of our efforts that do not lead to the outcome we desire as failures, but that these are actually near-wins (the sprinter who gets Sliver rather than Gold) that force us to surpass ourselves the next time in ways we might not otherwise if it were it not for the 'near' in 'near-win'</em></strong>. P.S.: She is a Harvard alum. It's a good read. I found it terse at times. It is full of references to works of literature I have not read and that the author uses to hammer in some points (and to facts I should have known: what was Samuel Morse's occupation prior to his inventing the telegraph?). You should check out her <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sarah_lewis_embrace_the_near_win?language=en">Ted Talk</a>!</p>
<p>This concept of near-win is of utmost importance in academia where we encounter failure (near-wins) more often than not, and must figure out how to pick up our selves and march on. I plan to write a post about failure in the near future, as well as a few posts about my experience interviewing for academic positions!</p>
